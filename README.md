This notebook we using publicly dataset On-line Retail to explore customer segmentation through the interesting task of unsupervised learning method. Then we go further and apply association rule mining approach to find interesting rules and patterns in this transaction database. These customer segmentation, rules and patterns can be used to make interesting and useful decisions as far as user interest is concerned.

The Online Retail a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.

Customer segmentation: Customer segmentation is the problem of uncovering information about a firm's customer base, based on their interactions with the business. In most cases this interaction is in terms of their purchase behavior and patterns. We explore some of the ways in which this can be used.
Market basket analysis: Market basket analysis is a method to gain insights into granular behavior of customers. This is helpful in devising strategies which uncovers deeper understanding of purchase decisions taken by the customers. This is interesting as a lot of times even the customer will be unaware of such biases or trends in their purchasing behavior.
